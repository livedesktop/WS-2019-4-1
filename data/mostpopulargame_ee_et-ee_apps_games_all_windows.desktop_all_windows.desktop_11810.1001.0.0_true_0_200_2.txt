We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9RW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"2048+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54134.9007199266252230.c3def203-4229-40dc-b092-acf37f362f70.ea43244f-6f4b-4431-ad9b-b6f9477257cd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#faf8ef","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14226.9007199266252230.877513c0-315f-454e-b71e-e0f8de9d2041.3d7de6a1-3694-47fb-874b-a73e8a9c3015","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#faf8ef","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["3718.20482048_8aydmnc5fg7fe"],"ContentIds":["76c3b3f3-fbf8-dce8-8161-355054aef67b","23b39a9c-eac7-3690-8b94-391e34f3b63e","a2443d1f-f89d-bdcd-99d7-9813b180aa93","dbc30d99-3767-c0a8-a95c-6f4defb4f074","64409e47-606c-ef58-3e65-484ae7ce118a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"2048+ is a Windows version of 2048.\r\nHow to play: \r\nuse your Touch, Mouse or arrow keys or ←↑↓→ to move the tiles.

Rain or wind outside, start flying right now! \r\n\r\nThe program includes many popular helicopter models of different type:\r\n- Beginners co-axial models\r\n- Entry level collective pitch models\r\n- Advanced fully 3D aerobatic models\r\n- High fidelity scale models\r\n\r\nWe also include many RC plane models, RC boat and RC car models. This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJXT1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Peppa Memory","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24181.9007199266268904.7586a68c-4af0-4cf8-a4e9-83d8de9f32ab.19e563b7-76aa-4c6a-8403-2bb087239a48","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0099CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.51744.9007199266268904.c27cba50-fad6-4985-8267-4edd4d7dfe79.6b68cdc0-67ac-4923-b9a7-af63808750eb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0099CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["51932ColomboEmanuele.PeppaMemory_64vy2y6zhr7gc"],"ContentIds":["531a36cf-ba69-7a14-0442-e9079fa6431f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Peppa Memory game with 3 level, very funny, where you will find many of your favorite characters.

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMLVN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bad Nerd - School RPG","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42124.9007199266448791.fa0f079b-e09a-4f6f-b62c-750d93c49e04.c67d47ed-c550-4153-b2ca-abd4c540ad7f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37851.9007199266448791.38f4e3d1-2a40-46ed-8922-da8f66fc0a8f.b25a6a7b-fec8-494f-97ad-6d2dd7054196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["VNLEntertainmentLtd.BadNerd-SchoolRPG_xaadq54jk5f4e"],"ContentIds":["9c1b78c6-a5f1-37dc-2e3a-5e8b7dfc5188","1bc338f0-29e1-673b-8b47-bd665e2370be"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NOTE: This game requires touch input and does not support mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\nSee a nerd unleash the nerd rage like never before!\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of modern action RPGs with lots of fighting then you will love Bad Nerd!\r\nJoin Bad Nerd in his quest to rid the school of bullies!
